      <h1>2.1 Browser Objects</h1>
      <p>Just like Javascript, web browsers have built-in <b>Browser Objects</b> that are made available to save time in coding.  There are many objects, including the window object, which represents the browsers frame that contains the web page, the history object which tracks the users pages visited, the location object which contains data about the current page's location.</p>
      </br>
      <h2>General Syntax</h2>
      <p>The window object is a global object, which means you do not have to type it's name specifically, so these two lines are equal:</p>
      <p class="js">window.alert("Hello");</p>
      <p class="js">alert("Hello");</p>
      <p>Otherwise, referencing browser objects is the same as all other objects.</p>
      </br>
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>The window object has many methods including the prompt() method which provides a pop up window asking the user to enter data.  Another common method is the alert() method which provides a pop up window advising the user of some information.</p>
      <p>The history object has methods like the go() method, which takes a parameter to specify how far forward or back in the history to go.</p>
      <p>The location object has methods like the replace() method, which replaces the current page displayed with a new page.</p>  
      </br>
      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <p>The window object has many properties like .closed which returns a boolean value of whether the window has been closed or not, and .docment which returns the document object for the window.</p>
      <p>The history object has one property .length which returns the number of URLs in the history.</p>
      <p>The location object has an .href property which allows you to add the currently loaded page to history.</p>
      </br>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      </p>Here is an example of Javascript code:</p>
      <p class="js">//script example for 2.1 Browser Objects</p>
      <p class="js">function showExample() {</p>
      <p class="js2">alert("This alert pop up window is already an example of a browser object!  But let's look at some more.");</p>
      <p class="js2">var historyLength = history.length;</p>
      <p class="js2">alert("You have " + historyLength + " URLs in your browser history");</p>
      <p class="js2">var screenColours = screen.colorDepth;</p>
      <p class="js2">alert("Your screen has " + screenColours + " colours");</p>
      <p class="js">}</p>        
      <script>
        //script example for 2.1 Browser Objects
        function showExample() {
          alert("This alert pop up window is already an example of a browser object!  But let's look at some more.");
          var historyLength = history.length;
          alert("You have " + historyLength + " URLs in your browser history");
          var screenColours = screen.colorDepth;
          alert("Your screen has " + screenColours + " colours");
        }
      </script>
      <input type="button" value="Click to see this Javascript example in action!" onclick="showExample()"/> 
    </div>
